# Auto Git Push

After completing code changes or updates to this project:

1. **Stage** all modified and new files: `git add` the relevant paths (or `git add -A` if the whole change set should go up).
2. **Commit** with a short, descriptive message (e.g. what was changed or fixed).
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push` (use `git_write` and `network` permissions when running these commands).

Do not ask for confirmation before pushing; proceed automatically once changes are done.
